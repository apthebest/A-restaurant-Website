Notes:
 whenever there is a GET request for an url,it is first sent to the project's urls.py and then we import "include" and we transfer this request to myapps's urls.py and from there first the views.py file is imported and then with the help of path function the request is sent to views.py where we write functions for each url request.
 it is to be noted that "HttpResponse" is used to print some string on the page 
but ideally it is recommended to use templates instead of simply printing something on the page
 for that we create two folders
1.static 2.templates
static folder is created just if you want to share some files(images,text) publicly,and you must in no case should store something highly confidential/private in your static folder
Note:For handling static folder go to settings.py of your project and as soon as you create a static folder a static url will be generated in the settings.py
Note:For handling templates we go to settings.py and in it to templates.it is to be rememebered that we use templates to store our html,css,js files and since everythings gonna come to view we go to view and change our index function to "return render(request,name_of_file)" what this will do is it as soon as you open your homepage "your file name_of_file" will be displayed
Now suppose you want to pass a variable to the template form views.py,what we can do to achieve this is:-we open the file in the template to which we wanna pass a value and we write(variable value is{{variable}}) and then we go to views create a python dictionary having the key value of variable and pass the name of the dictionary as the third argument of the render function!
if you want to use the default authentication system provided by django we have to read/write with that default table
creating a super user:open the terminal and write "python manage.py createsuperuser"
it is to be noted that all the information/data is going to be stored in the database which we will enter after creating a superuser
Template inheritance:suppose we want to inherit header and footer of a homepage(Say) in some other page and then improvise,in that case we use template inheritance,so we have to create blocks
Note:All the images you import from the internet or anywhere should be kept in the static folder
suppose we want to see the file in the database by its name/or in some other way we'd like,we can do this by going to the models.py and use the __str__(self) function
Now,suppose we want to access any of the elements from your database we dont always need to go to the django admin to check we can check it right here in the vs code by writing a simple command in the terminal :"python manage.py shell" this command gives us the privilege to use all the django models;for example say if we write from myapp.models import Contact, the Contact will be imported! and we can access this contact using django queries.To view all the objects we can write a command-"from myapp.models import whateveryouwanttoimport" and in the next command- "whateveryouwanttoimport.objects.all()" this command will provide us with a list of elements which we have created in our objects!Now suppose out of all these elements we want to get more/detailed info about any specific element then we can write a command like this-whateveryouwanttoimport.objects.all()[0].email/name/desc/no etc. Now suppose we want to filter some specific elements the we can write a command like this-"whateveryouwanttoimport.objects.filter(property='string you are looking for')"For more such queries consult this website-https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/ NOte:-".first()&.last() are used to retrieve the first and the lst element in a given list"
